* switch procTag to initialize method
* look through tests with an eye to making extraction/testing easier
* S4 classes: list slots (and types). default usage? or rely on the constructor? only use @slots when not documenting constructor
* update object_from_call and default tags system to resolve last test issues
* need tests for multiple tags in a single block (e.g. @s3method)
* need to extend object from call to deal with a <- set[Ref]Class("a") and
  to generate package objects.  Would be nice to be able to document non-local
  objects - @objValue a, @objValue getClass("a") ?
* convert rd object to S4 for consistency
* implement useDynLib with test cases
* is_s3_generic should do better if you do c <- function() 1
* DOCUMENTATION!

# Default tags

* Move out of Block and into parse.r
* Really need to be given whole block, and run in the same order as other tags.
* Aliases needs to add @name, not override, rdname should use @name
