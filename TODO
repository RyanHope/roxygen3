* roccers -> functions which take package as input, plus associated tag
* rewrite all output methods
* run tests
* fix usage of rd_command and *_tag

* "tags" that previously applied to all blocks:
  * docType

Questions for Vitalie:

* How would you write modify_tags?
* procBlockObject vs procBlock - only three tags need to dispatch on object
  * need to think of common function name for that scenario 
    procObj(tag, obj, block)

* What's a better way of writing procBlock for docType so that it doesn't use
  pseudo dispatch

* Should procTag be initTag?

* A roccer is something that operates on the whole package - 

Better to call them processors? They take a Package and return a modified Package. They have a separate argument?

Roxygenise gets arguments:
* tags
* roccers
