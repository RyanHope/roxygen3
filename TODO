* update object_from_call and default tags system to resolve last test issues
* need tests for multiple tags in a single block (e.g. @s3method)
* need to extend object from call to deal with a <- set[Ref]Class("a") and to generate package objects.  Would be nice to be able to document non-local objects - @objValue a, @objValue getClass("a") ?
* DOCUMENTATION!
* better rd wrapping

# Default tags

* Move out of Block and into parse.r
* Really need to be given whole block, and run in the same order as other tags.
* Aliases needs to add @name, not override, rdname should use @name
