* need tests for multiple tags in a single block (e.g. @s3method)
* DOCUMENTATION!
* better rd wrapping (waiting on Rd package)

# Default tags

* Move out of Block and into parse.r
* Really need to be given whole block, and run in the same order as other tags.
* Aliases needs to add @name, not override, rdname should use @name
