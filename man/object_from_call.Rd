\title{[DEV] Given a call that modifies the R environment, find the object that
it creates.}
\usage{
  object_from_call(call, env, srcref)
}
\arguments{
  \item{call}{unevaluated function call}

  \item{env}{environment in which to evaluate function
  call}
}

\value{
  a list giving the \code{name} and \code{value} of the
  object that the call creates.  \code{NULL} is returned if
  the call doesn't modify the package environment in a way
  that roxygen recognises.
}
\description{
  This function is aimed primarily at developers extending
  this package. You shouldn't need to use it for everyday
  operation of the package.

  Given a call that modifies the R environment, find the
  object that it creates.
}
\details{
  \code{object_from_call} works in a pseudo-S3 manner -
  given a call like \code{f(a, b, c)} it will call
  \code{object_from_call.f}.
}
\examples{
a <- 1
object_from_call(quote(a <- 1), environment())
}
