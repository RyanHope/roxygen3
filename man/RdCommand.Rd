\description{
This function is aimed primarily at developers extending this package.
You shouldn't need to use it for everyday operation.

commands have two methods: \code{merge} and \code{format}.  Currently for all
commands, merge just combines all values, and format selects from these to
display the commands in the appropriate way.
