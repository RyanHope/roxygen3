* `@export`ing an S3 generic will also export all of its methods

* roxygen3 automatically determines if a function is an s3 generic or method
  and modifies the components accordingly

* `@autoImports` automatically figures out all the functions you need to
  import. You just need to make sure the packages are listed in the
  `DESCRIPTION` file under imports.
